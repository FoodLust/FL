## Introduction
Food Lust is a social site for food lovers.

## Basic Functionality
* Users can brows meals by date, top rated or by user. 
* Users can sign up for the app.
* Once logged in users can:
    * upload meals
    * like and dislike others' meals
    * Follow and unfollow other users
    * Visit their profile to see their account info, list of meals and list of followed and following users.

## Known issues
If a user signs up and clicks on the confirmation link in the email it works. If they click on the same link a second time they might get a 500 error. Even if they get a 500 error the sign up still worked and the user can log in.
